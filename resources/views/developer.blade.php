                    <p>Knowing me would require the one thing I value more than anything, time. This is also my biggest strength, as I spend it, very wisely and use it very effectively. <br>

<br>

I am an analyst in nature, with a background in investments, property and concurrently, programming. To keep to my "career" that would interest you, I started developing by designing websites with not-so-great builders, over 10 years ago. <br>

<br>

Since then I have studied across various fields, using my practical learning methods, I soared through various aspects of programming languages. It should be noted that I by no means believe I am experienced enough! All major languages receive regular updates, even Java! (I do enjoy Java - even though its only mostly used by banks, it is simple and strict). Learning is the key to staying on top of things! <br>

<br>

I enjoy working with challenges, hence the nature of my "career". I enjoy pressure, and when I do not have it, I tend to create it - my wife can vouch for that. As I write this for you, I am also working on a private project which I am hoping will be released to the world in the New Year and has been taking up my spare months for quite some time now. <br>

<br>

I have already sent Imke some details on "what I know" and if you need more please let me know. I would prefer fast forms of communication rather than endless lines of words, that frankly take far too long to type. <br>

<br>

I am available on the phone every morning between 8-9am, I do prefer email as this is generally my reading time which I crave when I miss it. I do respond via email quickly. <br>

<br>

Speak soon. <br>
